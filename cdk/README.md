# cdk

This is the infra required to make this demo work.

[Docker](https://docker.com) is required for this demo. It packages the go app in a docker container.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
